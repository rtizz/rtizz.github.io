    <h2><strong>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?</strong></h2>
      <p>Dec 19, 2022</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The if-else statement is used to choose between teo options, but the seithc case statement is used to choose between numerous options.</li>
        <li>If the conidition inside the if block is false, the statement inside the else block is executed. If the condition inside the switch statement is false, the default statements are run.</li>
        <li>If-else values are determined by constraints whereas switch case values are determined by user preferences.</li>
        <li id="duh"><strong>It's difficult to make changes to if/else statements because it is time consuming to figure out where the change needs to be made. Switch Statements, on the other hands are simple to change since they are easy to trace</strong></li>
        <li>For numerous statements, you can use several if statements. For numerous statements in Switch, you only have one expression.</li>

      <p>Both parameters have their pros and cons; switch statements provide a limited subset of evaluations it can make (only char and int) where if-else is much more verbose and allows for multiple statements and multiple logic. However, switch statements are much easier to implement and modify making them very fast. Overall if the logic required is more on the simplistic side, switch statement is more than likely your go-to.</p>

    <h2><strong>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</strong></h2>
    
    <h3>Single Equal Sign '='</h3>
    <p>A single '=' is used to for allocated specific values to variables.
        Ex. (int String <strong>=</strong> name</p>
    <img src="./images/=.png" 
    height="400"
    width="700" />


    <h3>Double Equal Sign '=='</h3>
    <p>Generally speaking "==" in operator which compares two objects in Java, as well as checks if both object point to the same memory location.</p>
    <img src="./images/==.png" 
    height="400"
    width="700" />


    <h3>Equals Method '.equals()'</h3>
    <p> .equals() and '==' both share similarities, however the main difference between both of them is that one is an operator and the 
    other is a method.</p>
